                                Coming Out of Nowhere is a 2-6 player game where a group of seemingly misfit
                                teens band together to escape a dead-end town as they discovered
                                that the local sheriff has been brainwashing people.
                                Work together and tag along with your newfound friends as you collect items
                                and plan out your best means of escape. Make sure to avoid the sheriff and his deputy partner 
                                patrolling this idle town. Time's ticking before you're brainwashed for good.

                                In the Realm of Faerie, the Fey Courts can agree on two things: rules are malleable,
                                and contracts are binding. Play as the ever-so-loved and benevolent Faerie Queene. 
                                Take root as the Lord of the Forest and slowly encroach on the other Courts. 
                                Plot and scheme as the Trickster Envoy and undermine the competition.
                                Or rise up with ferocious power as the Imperator Animalis and prove your might.
                                Which court can come up on top to establish themselves as the great Fey Court for the next century?
